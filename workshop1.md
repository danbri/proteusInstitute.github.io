## **The First Proteus Workshop**

### **What?**

Emphasis will be placed on recruiting a development team, scoping general requirements, identifying key enabling technologies and potential applications.

Topics to be discussed will include relevant software engineering methods and off-the-shelf tools, lessons learned from previous similar efforts (e.g. OpenWorm, the Blue Brain Project, TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym), biology-to-ALife best practices, physics engines, exporting designs to physical hardware (sim2real) and biological artifacts (sim2life), volunteer coding organization, timelining, and other related efforts.

Anyone is welcome to sit in and observe, or actively participate in the brainstorming and (eventually) software development activities.

### **Where?**
