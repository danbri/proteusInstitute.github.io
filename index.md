Thinkers, builders, and artists throughout history have looked to nature for inspiration. Most recently, the founders of what has become the Artificial Intelligence revolution drew inspiration from one particular biological mechanism: how the connections between neurons change in response to experience. But, this particular mechanism is but one of millions of "hacks" that nature has evolved to enable organisms to grapple intelligently with their environment. What new kinds of technologies may be possible if we systemically unlocked these other secrets, and built them into new kinds of machines and algorithms?

That is the goal of The Proteus Institute. 

# Technical Summary

We are one of several [NSF NAIRI](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/announcements/082620.jsp) planning [projects](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2020247&HistoricalAwards=false).

Living systems continue to outstrip the most adaptive state-of-the-art AI and robotics. One reason for this is that, without exception, organisms and species constantly restructure themselves at all organizational levels, from the microsecond- to millennial time scales; most machines do not. Almost all AI and robots incorporate change at just one time scale -- that of synaptic plasticity -- and in one modality: neural networks. We thus propose to study embodied plasticity: how multi-level change supports intelligence in protean systems (cells, organs, organisms, and ecologies), and how best to channel those discoveries into protean machines (robots and artificial biological constructs) and algorithms (machine learning methods).
