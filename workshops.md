# Workshops

Typically, investigators write code or build robots from scratch
whenever starting a new AI or robotics project.
This leads to specialized systems
brittle to novel challenges, and lack of reproducibility.
Or, off-the-shelf software such as TensorFlow is employed, which restricts
work to well-studied phenomena such as synaptic plasticity.
These efforts traditionally have difficulty integrating tightly with efforts in biology. 

To prove this cycle can be broken, we plan to develop and deploy an open-source, continually running, cloud-based code base in which increasingly protean machines and algorithms are automatically designed using biological change phenomena (BCPs) incorporated as software patches.
To test how this approach accelerates transferal of
adaptive mechanisms from biology to AI and robotics, we will host a series of workshops to initially brainstorm and then construct such a code base. Anyone willing and able to contribute code to such an effort is welcome to participate.

## Proteus2020

The first of several planned workshops.

### Where? 
The Virtual Artificial Life (ALife) Conference.

### When?
July 13-18, 2020

### Who?
Organizer: Josh Bongard

Participants: To be determined.

### What?
Brainstorming session on constructing cyberinfrastructure that hosts continually-evolving agents. Research groups can code up software patches that simulate biological mechanisms. If those mechanisms are grafted into the agents by the evolutionary algorithm, this provides indirect evidence that
